This repository contains various investing tools I have used to make returns of 20% per year in the stock market

## Business_Intrinsic_Value.xlsx
- Uses discounted cash flows method to evaluate what a business is worth
- If intrinsic value is less than market cap, the stock is undervalued
- Can be used to estimate expected returns if price moves up to fair value

## compound_interest.xlsx
- To gain perspective on how fast compound interest grows over time given interest rate

## Kelly_Critereon.xlsx
- Used to figure out how much to invest on a single investment
- For example, if one were to bet heads on a weighted coin with 60% chance of showing heads, betting all of your money every time would eventually leave you broke

## margin_of_safety.xlsx
- A concept favored by many notable investors such as Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham
- Used to caluclate the returns based on a specified margin of safety
